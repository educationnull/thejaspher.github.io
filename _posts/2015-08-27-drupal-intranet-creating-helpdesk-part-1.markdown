With Drupal, you are able to create large sites with complex models and relations with barely any coding.

Iâ€™ve provided this as a Feature you can download and install on your site.

Specifications
--------------

In this example, we need to create a helpdesk with the following specifications:

-   Standard content type: helpdesk\_ticket
-   Two roles - authenticated users and Helpdesk administrators
-   Must be internal - only authenticated users can submit tickets.
-   Only Helpdesk admins can change ticket status (pending, closed, etc)
-   Users can: Submit tickets and view their own tickets.
-   Recieve email notifications when an update to a ticket is made.

Proposed workflow

1.  Authenticated user creates a ticket
2.  User and Helpdesk recieves email notification on new ticket
3.  Helpesk/ user go back and fourth on tickets via comment section, each comment gets an email notification
4.  Helpdesk closes ticket via comment section, with corresponding email notification

Required third-party modules:

-   Rules (For sending email notifications)
-   Comment Alter (For editing ticket properties via the comments)
-   Content Access (Give users access to only their tickets/ give helpdesk access to all tickets)
-   Field Permissions (Allow only helpdesk to change ticket status)
-   Pathauto (we will set the url pattern for Helpdesk tickets. NIDs will become the ticket number)
