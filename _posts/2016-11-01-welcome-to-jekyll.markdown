I've moved this blog from drupal to Github Pages powered by Jekyll. So many reasons behind this, but quickly:

1. I dont need to manage the server anymore
2. Blog will load very quickly becuase static pages are being served
3. It's free

More info: [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
